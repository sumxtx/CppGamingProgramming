#### TODO s

These Projects Codes are mostly from the book. With a few improvements i added.

In each Project Folder there's a TODO file, with the improvements needed in each game.
To expand the books code, and make the games even more playable and enjoyable.

My Goal is not to be game developer, i just want to learn C++ Design Patterns,
and how it works with large projects with lots of components and classes,
so i won't right now be focusing on improving these games further. I'm going
to pass to another book.

Maybe in the future i come back and improve them
