- This game has a great potential of expansion

- Improve Build tools (Cmake, auto build SFML Library)
- Apply Factory Design pattern from Run Game and improve Start/Pause Menu
- Add some Music with the SoundEngine from that pattern
- Rebalance some stuff
  - zombie speed based on level
  - pickups when map is large are harder to find, making level unnecesarily long
    looking for ammo
  - when reloading ammo gets spoiled
    like if you have 6/28 -> shoots -> 5/28 -> reloads -> 6/22 instead of 6/27
- Add New Weapons
- Add Minimap
- Add more zombie types
- Improve animations
- Add Zombie Sounds
