<div align="center" text-align="center" justify="center">
These Codes are mostly from the book with a few enhancements i've added.<br>
In each Project Folder there's a TODO file, with the improvements needed in each game<br>
to expand the books code even further and make the games even more playable and enjoyable.<br>  
<br>
My Goal is not to be game developer,  
i just want to learn C++ and Design Patterns,<br>
and how it works on large projects with lots of components and classes,<br>
so i won't right now be focusing on improving these games further.<br>
I'm going to pass to another books.
<br>
Maybe in the future i come back and improve them

### Project 4
## [Endless Run](https://github.com/sumxtx/CppGamingProgramming/tree/main/EndlessRun)

</div>

<div align="justify" text-align="left" justify="justify">
A Run-Game where platforms spawn in front of the player and despawn behind. If the player is on, or has fell and is in, a despawned platform frame, is game over.
Some fireballs also spawn in random directions in front and back towards the player, if the player is hit by a fireball, he is knocked down and fell.
If he is at a platform in the time of knock down, he feels off.
The boost helps to reach platforms, or go back if fallen, but is not that powerful, the fell off platforms may caught up the player.
