## Project 4
#### [Endless Run](https://github.com/sumxtx/CppGamingProgramming/tree/main/EndlessRun)

A Run-Game where platforms spawn in front of the player and despawn behind. If the player is on, or has fell and is in, a despawned platform frame, is game over.
Some fireballs also spawn in random directions in front and back towards the player, if the player is hit by a fireball, he is knocked down and fell.
If he is at a platform in the time of knock down, he feels off.
The boost helps to reach platforms, or go back if fallen, but is not that powerful, the fell off platforms may caught up the player.
